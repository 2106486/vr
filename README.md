VR Train tracker
by Zsolt Hollo

The location and speed of the currently running VR trains are pulled regularly from rata.digitraffic.fi/api.
The trains are listed in the left navigation pane besides their current speed and the amount of data-points pulled so far. Click on any of these trains to get a diagram with the speed statistics for the last 6 minutes.
